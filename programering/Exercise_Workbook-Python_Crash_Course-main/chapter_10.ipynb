    "\n",
    "This notebook contains exercises from Chapter 10 of Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes. Each exercise focuses on reading from and writing to files, handling exceptions, and working with file data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives:\n",
    "- Read from files using `open()` and file methods\n",
    "- Write to files and create new files\n",
    "- Handle file paths and work with different file formats\n",
    "- Use exception handling with `try-except` blocks\n",
    "- Handle common exceptions like `FileNotFoundError`\n",
    "- Store data using the `json` module\n",
    "- Work with user input and file validation\n",
    "- Practice defensive programming techniques\n",

    "**Important Principles:**\n",
    "- Always use `with` statements when working with files\n",
    "- Handle exceptions gracefully to prevent crashes\n",
    "- Provide meaningful error messages to users\n",
    "- Validate user input and file data\n",
    "- Use appropriate file formats for different types of data\n",
    "- Test your programs with both valid and invalid inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices Learned:**\n",
    "- Defensive programming: anticipate and handle errors\n",
    "- Separation of concerns: organize code into focused functions\n",
    "- Data persistence: save and retrieve application state\n",
    "- User experience: provide clear feedback and error messages\n",
    "- Code organization: structure programs for maintainability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "- Review any exercises you found challenging\n",
    "- Practice with larger files and more complex data structures\n",
    "- Experiment with other file formats (XML, binary files, etc.)\n",
