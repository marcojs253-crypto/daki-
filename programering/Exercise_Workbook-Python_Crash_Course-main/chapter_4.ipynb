    "- Copying lists properly vs. creating references\n",
    "- Using tuples for immutable sequences\n",
    "- List comprehensions for concise list creation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts Practiced:**\n",
    "- For loop syntax: `for item in list:`\n",
    "- Range function: `range(start, stop, step)`\n",
    "- List slicing: `list[start:end]`, `list[:3]`, `list[-3:]`\n",
    "- List copying: `new_list = old_list[:]` or `new_list = old_list.copy()`\n",
    "- Tuple immutability and when to use tuples vs. lists\n",
    "- List comprehensions: `[expression for item in range()]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "- Review any exercises you found challenging\n",
