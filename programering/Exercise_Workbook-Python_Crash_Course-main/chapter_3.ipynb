    "- Adding elements with `append()` and `insert()`\n",

    "- Organizing lists with `sort()`, `sorted()`, and `reverse()`\n",
    "- Finding list length with `len()`\n",

    "**Key Concepts Practiced:**\n",
    "- List indexing (positive and negative)\n",
    "- List methods: `.append()`, `.insert()`, `.pop()`, `.remove()`, `.sort()`, `.reverse()`\n",
    "- Built-in functions: `sorted()`, `len()`\n",
    "- The `del` statement\n",
    "- Understanding and handling index errors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "- Review any exercises you found challenging\n",
    "- Practice creating and manipulating different types of lists\n",
    "- Move on to Chapter 4: Working with Lists (loops and list comprehensions)\n",
