    "- Creating game windows and handling events\n",
    "- Drawing shapes and images on screen\n",
    "- Handling keyboard input for game controls\n",
    "- Managing game objects with classes\n",
    "- Implementing game mechanics like movement and collision\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Pygame Functions:**\n",
    "- `pygame.init()` - Initialize Pygame\n",
    "- `pygame.display.set_mode()` - Create game window\n",
    "- `pygame.event.get()` - Handle events\n",
    "- `screen.fill()` - Fill screen with color\n",
    "- `pygame.display.flip()` - Update display\n",
    "- `pygame.draw.rect()` - Draw rectangles\n",
