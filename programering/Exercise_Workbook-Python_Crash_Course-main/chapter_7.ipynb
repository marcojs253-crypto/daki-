    "Congratulations! You've completed all the exercises for Chapter 7 on User Input and While Loops. You should now be comfortable with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Getting user input with the `input()` function\n",
    "- Converting string input to integers with `int()`\n",
    "- Using while loops for repeated execution\n",
    "- Controlling loops with flags, conditions, and `break`\n",
    "- Processing lists with while loops\n",
    "- Removing specific values from lists\n",
    "- Building interactive programs with user input\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts Practiced:**\n",
    "- User input: `input()` function and type conversion\n",
    "- While loop syntax and control\n",
    "- Loop control: `break`, `continue`, and flags\n",
    "- List processing with `pop()` and `remove()`\n",
    "- Interactive program design\n",
    "- Data collection and storage in dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Notes:**\n",
    "- Always convert `input()` to appropriate data type when needed\n",
    "- Be careful with infinite loops - always ensure there's an exit condition\n",
    "- Use meaningful variable names for flags and counters\n",
    "- Consider user experience when designing interactive programs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "- Review any exercises you found challenging\n",
    "- Practice creating more interactive programs\n",
    "- Experiment with different loop control techniques\n",
