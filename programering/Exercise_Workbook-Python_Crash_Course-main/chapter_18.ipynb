    "# Python Crash Course - Chapter 18: Testing Your Code\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains exercises from Chapter 18 of Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes. This chapter focuses on writing automated tests to ensure your code works correctly, implementing test-driven development practices, and building robust, reliable software.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives:\n",
    "- Write unit tests using Python's unittest module\n",
    "- Test functions, classes, and methods systematically\n",
    "- Implement test-driven development (TDD) practices\n",
    "- Use assertions to verify expected behavior\n",
    "- Test edge cases and error conditions\n",
    "- Organize and structure test suites effectively\n",
    "- Mock external dependencies and API calls\n",
    "- Measure test coverage and code quality\n",

    "**Best Practices to Remember:**\n",
    "- **Write tests early and often** - don't wait until the end\n",
    "- **Test behavior, not implementation** - focus on what code should do\n",
    "- **Keep tests simple and focused** - one concept per test\n",
    "- **Use descriptive test names** - tests should document expected behavior\n",
    "- **Maintain your tests** - update them as code evolves\n",
    "- **Aim for high coverage** - but prioritize quality over quantity\n",

    "*Note: Testing is not just about finding bugs - it's about building confidence in your code, enabling safe refactoring, and creating documentation through examples. Good testing practices separate professional developers from hobbyists. The investment in learning testing pays dividends throughout your entire programming career. Code without tests is legacy code the moment it's written!*"
