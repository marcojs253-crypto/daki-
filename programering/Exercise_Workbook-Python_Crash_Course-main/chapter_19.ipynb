    "This notebook contains exercises from Chapter 19 of Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes. This chapter focuses on implementing user authentication, managing user accounts, securing web applications, and building robust user management systems in Django.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives:\n",
    "- Implement user registration and authentication systems\n",
    "- Create secure login and logout functionality\n",
    "- Manage user accounts and profiles\n",
    "- Implement password security and validation\n",
    "- Restrict access to pages based on user authentication\n",
    "- Create user-specific data and permissions\n",
    "- Handle user sessions and security tokens\n",
    "- Implement password reset functionality\n",
    "- Apply security best practices in web development\n",
    "- Build scalable user management systems\n",

    "*Note: Security is not a feature you add at the end—it's a fundamental aspect that must be considered throughout the entire development process. User authentication and authorization are critical components of any web application. The techniques learned in this chapter form the foundation of secure web development. Remember: a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and in web security, that's often the authentication system. Invest time in understanding and implementing these concepts properly—your users' data depends on it!*"
