    "Congratulations! You've completed all the exercises for Chapter 8 on Functions. You should now be comfortable with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Defining functions with the `def` statement\n",
    "- Passing arguments to functions (positional and keyword)\n",
    "- Setting default parameter values\n",
    "- Returning values from functions\n",
    "- Using `*args` for arbitrary positional arguments\n",
    "- Using `**kwargs` for arbitrary keyword arguments\n",
    "- Importing functions from modules\n",
    "- Following PEP 8 style guidelines for functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts Practiced:**\n",
    "- Function definition syntax: `def function_name(parameters):`\n",
    "- Docstrings for function documentation\n",
    "- Parameter types: positional, keyword, default values\n",
    "- Arbitrary arguments: `*args` and `**kwargs`\n",
    "- Return statements and return values\n",
    "- Module imports and function organization\n",
    "- Code style and readability best practices\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Principles:**\n",
    "- Functions should do one thing well (single responsibility)\n",
    "- Use descriptive function and parameter names\n",
    "- Include docstrings to document function behavior\n",
    "- Consider using default values for optional parameters\n",
    "- Be careful when modifying lists passed to functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "- Review any exercises you found challenging\n",
    "- Practice breaking down complex problems into functions\n",
    "- Experiment with different parameter combinations\n",
    "- Move on to Chapter 9: Classes\n",
